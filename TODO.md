## 🗒️ Notes
- **Feedback improvement**  
  Keep examples of unnatural phrasing and offer simplified alternatives  
- **Pronunciation exercises**  
  Focus on words like “further” using Russian-language intuition  
- **Clear purpose & trackable progress**  
  Design exercises so users can see measurable improvement in speaking  
- **Integrate grammar learning**  
  Cover conditionals, “-ish” suffix, etc., alongside speaking drills  
- **Resource constraint**  
  The internet isn’t much help for bespoke exercise creation  
- **Organization**  
  Migrate other language-learning materials into this repo’s structure
